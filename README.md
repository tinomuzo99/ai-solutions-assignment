# AI Solutions Engineer Assignment – Risk Scoring Script

This project implements a lightweight, rule-based system that analyses WhatsApp-style health conversations to estimate the risk of HIV acquisition and mental health disorders. Recommendations are generated based on South African NDoH guidelines, including the 2023 ART Clinical Guidelines and the National Mental Health Policy Framework (2023–2030). Users can run the solution either through the Jupyter Notebook (`AI Solutions Assignment_TinoMuzondidya.ipynb`) or the Python script (`risk_analysis.py`). The notebook provides an interactive step-by-step analysis, while the script processes all conversations and outputs results to `conversation_risk_results.csv`. Install dependencies using `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, and ensure the dataset file (`health_ai_whatsapp_100_conversations_long.txt`) is placed in the project directory before running either method.
